# Extensions

Extensions allow adding functionality to a type that is already defined. I can use extensions to create new properties or methods for standard Swift types, such as Int, String, Bool, and Array, or custom types I have defined for my application. Extensions are also useful for organizing my code into logical snippets, such as the code needed for a type to adopt a protocol.

In this lesson, I learned how and why to use extensions.

## What I Learned
- Common reasons to use extensions.
- How to define an extension to add functionality to a predefined type.

## Vocabulary
- `extension`: Mechanism that allows adding functionality to an existing type.
- `mutate`: Change the state or structure of an object.
