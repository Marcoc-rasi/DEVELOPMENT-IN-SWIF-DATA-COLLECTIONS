# Closures

Closures can be a challenging topic for new developers, but many frameworks for building applications use them extensively. When understood and used correctly, they can be a powerful tool for writing clean, reusable, and high-performance code. It's not necessary to master closures at this stage, but it's essential to be familiar with how to work with them.

This lesson introduced me to closures and showed me how to define them, use them as function arguments, and utilize some common functions that take closures as arguments. I will learn more about closures in future lessons as specific concepts apply to the projects I'll be building.

## What I Learned
- What a closure is.
- How to define a closure.
- How to pass a closure as an argument to a function.
- How to use the `sorted(by:)`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions.

## Vocabulary
- `capture`: Process of a closure storing and referencing surrounding values and variables.
- `closure`: Self-contained block of code that can be stored and executed later.
- `filter`: Function that filters elements from a collection based on a given criteria.
- `map`: Function that transforms each element of a collection according to a given rule.
- `reduce`: Function that combines all elements of a collection into a single value.
- `syntactic sugar`: Shortcuts in syntax that make the code easier to read and write.
