# Working with the Web: JSON Decoding

In this lesson, I have learned how to work with network services and `APIs`, as well as how to serialize `JSON` into model objects that can be used in an application.

## What I Learned

- Describe `JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) and the role `JSON` plays in working with network services
- Demonstrate how to read and write basic `JSON` data
- Demonstrate how to use `JSON` serialization to encode and decode `JSON`
- Demonstrate how to serialize `JSON` data into custom model objects

## Vocabulary
- `escaping closure`: A closure that escapes the scope in which it is defined.
- `throwing function`: A function that can throw an error during its execution.
