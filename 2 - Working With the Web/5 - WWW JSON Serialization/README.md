# Working with the Web: JSON Decoding

In the last lesson, I learned how to create and send a network request using the URLSession class. I also learned how URLs are constructed and how they can convey a request to a web server. I requested data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API, downloaded, and printed the server's response.

But in what format did the response come? Many modern web services return data in the format of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). In this lesson, I learned how to read basic data in JSON format. I also learned how to convert JSON into Swift types and custom model objects using the Codable protocol and a JSONDecoder.

## What I Learned
- How to read basic data in JSON format.
- How to use JSONDecoder to decode JSON.
- How to decode JSON data into custom Swift types.

## Vocabulary
- `escaping closure`: A closure that escapes the scope in which it is defined.
- `throwing function`: A function that can throw an error during its execution.
