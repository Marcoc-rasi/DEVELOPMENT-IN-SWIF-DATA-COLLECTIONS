### `Contest`

The "Contest" app allows users to enter their email address to enter a contest and win a prize. If they attempt to submit without providing an email address, the app uses animations to highlight the text field and alert the user that it needs to be completed to enter the contest.

In this code, a class named `ViewController` is defined, which inherits from `UIViewController.` View Controllers in iOS are responsible for the management of the user interface and view logic.

Within this class, a property named `emailTextField` is declared with the `@IBOutlet` attribute. This attribute signifies that this property is connected to a user interface element in Interface Builder, in this case, a text field.

The `viewDidLoad` method is automatically called when the view is loaded into memory. Currently, this method is empty, but it is used to perform additional configurations in the view, if necessary.

The `enterButtonDidTouchUpInside` method is executed when a button is tapped, in this case, the `Enter` button. Here, a check is performed: if the text field (`emailTextField`) is empty, the `performLabTextFieldShakeAnimation` method is called. Otherwise, a transition to another view is made using `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)`.

The `performLabTextFieldShakeAnimation` is a private method that carries out an animation on the text field (`emailTextField`) to simulate a `shake` effect when the field is empty. This animation employs a transformation that shifts the field 20 points to the right and then returns it to its original position. The total duration of the animation is 0.4 seconds, divided into two parts of 0.2 seconds each: 0.2 seconds for the shift and 0.2 seconds for returning to the original position.

Furthermore, an extension named `Challenge Solution` is provided, which defines a method `performChallengeTextFieldShakeAnimation.` This method executes a more intricate animation to simulate a `shake` effect on the text field. `UIView.animateKeyframes` is used to divide the animation into multiple steps or `keyframes.` Each keyframe horizontally shifts the text field and then returns it to its original position. This creates a more elaborate `shaking` effect that repeats several times.

In summary, this code represents a View Controller in an iOS application that performs animations in response to user interaction. The `shake` animation is utilized to indicate an empty text field, and the `Challenge Solution` extension offers a more complex version of the `shake` animation for experimentation or challenge purposes.
