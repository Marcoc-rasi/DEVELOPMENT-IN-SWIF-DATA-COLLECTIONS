### MusicWireframe

The app is a wireframe (a basic outline, with no real functionality) of the "Now Playing" screen in the music app.

The `ViewController class` contains several properties labeled with the `@IBOutlet` notation, which are associated with user interface (GUI) components. These properties include `albumImageView`, `reverseBackground`, `playPauseBackground`, `forwardBackground`, `reverseButton`, `playPauseButton`, and `forwardButton`.

The `playback state` is controlled by the `isPlaying` variable, which determines whether the music is playing (`true`) or paused (`false`). This state is visually reflected through the `playPauseButton`.

Within the `viewDidLoad` method, visual elements are configured, such as the `background buttons` referred to as `reverseBackground`, `playPauseBackground`, and `forwardBackground`. These elements are prepared for the interface by rounding their corners and initially hiding them with an `alpha` value of `0.0`.

The `playPauseButtonTapped` method is triggered when the `play/pause button` (`playPauseButton`) is tapped. If the music is playing (`isPlaying == true`), an `animation` is initiated that restores the album image to its `original size`. If the music is paused (`isPlaying == false`), an animation is executed that `reduces the size of the album image`.

The `touchedUpInside` and `touchedDown` methods are triggered when a button is released or touched, respectively. It is determined which of the buttons was manipulated (forward, `play/pause`, or reverse), and an `animation` affecting the associated visual elements, such as `buttonBackground`, is executed. When releasing the button (`touchedUpInside`), the elements return to their original state. When touching a button (`touchedDown`), visual effects are applied, including an increase in `opacity` and a slight `size reduction` of the button.

In summary, the code presents a view controller that manages a music playback interface, employing animations and visual interactions to enhance the user experience. When interacting with the playback, pause, and navigation buttons, animations are applied to provide visual feedback. The `album image` is also animated based on the playback state, contributing to a more engaging and dynamic user experience.
