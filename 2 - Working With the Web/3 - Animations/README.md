# Practical Animation

In this lesson, I learned how to make simple animations in the view to direct the user's attention, guide the user, or link user behaviors to improve the experience of using an application.

## What I Learned

- Demonstrate how to perform basic `UIView` animations
- List the view properties that can be animated
- Describe the appropriate role of custom animations in an app


## Vocabulary
- `affine transformation`: Mathematical operation that applies a linear transformation to graphic elements.
- `animation`: Process of gradually changing a property of an object over time.
- `concatenate`: Sequentially combine multiple transformations.
- `Core Animation`: Advanced animation framework in iOS.
- `live view`: Visual representation updated in real-time in a development environment like Playground.
- `PlaygroundPage`: Module that provides functions for interacting with a Playground at runtime.
- `PlaygroundSupport`: Framework that offers additional support for Playgrounds in Swift.
- `touch down`: Event that occurs when the screen or mouse is pressed.
- `touch up`: Event that occurs when the finger is lifted after a press.
- `transform`: Change the position, size, or orientation of an object.
- `wireframe model`: Visual representation of a three-dimensional object using lines instead of solid surfaces.

### `Contest`

The "Contest" app allows users to enter their email address to enter a contest and win a prize. If they attempt to submit without providing an email address, the app uses animations to highlight the text field and alert the user that it needs to be completed to enter the contest.

### MusicWireframe

The app is a wireframe (a basic outline, with no real functionality) of the "Now Playing" screen in the music app.
