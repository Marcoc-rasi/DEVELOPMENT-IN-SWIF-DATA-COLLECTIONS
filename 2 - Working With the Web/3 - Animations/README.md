# Practical Animation

Take a look at the most popular iOS apps, and you'll see elegant and subtle animations used to create a connection with the on-screen content. When implemented in the right places and at the right times, animation can provide feedback, enhance the sense of direct manipulation, or help users visualize the results of their actions.

In this lesson, I learned how to use the UIView class and closures to add animations that enhance the presentation and functionality of my apps.

## What I Learned
- How and when to use animations to improve the user experience.
- Which properties can be animated using UIKit.
- How to use UIKit to create basic animations.

## Vocabulary
- `affine transformation`: Mathematical operation that applies a linear transformation to graphic elements.
- `animation`: Process of gradually changing a property of an object over time.
- `concatenate`: Sequentially combine multiple transformations.
- `Core Animation`: Advanced animation framework in iOS.
- `live view`: Visual representation updated in real-time in a development environment like Playground.
- `PlaygroundPage`: Module that provides functions for interacting with a Playground at runtime.
- `PlaygroundSupport`: Framework that offers additional support for Playgrounds in Swift.
- `touch down`: Event that occurs when the screen or mouse is pressed.
- `touch up`: Event that occurs when the finger is lifted after a press.
- `transform`: Change the position, size, or orientation of an object.
- `wireframe model`: Visual representation of a three-dimensional object using lines instead of solid surfaces.
