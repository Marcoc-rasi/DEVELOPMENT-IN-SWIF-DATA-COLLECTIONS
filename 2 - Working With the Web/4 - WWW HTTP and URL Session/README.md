# Working with the Web: HTTP and URL

So far in this course, I've built applications that allow users to create data or use data from their devices. But there's a whole world of information on the internet. How can I allow users to access it or send information over the internet directly from my app?

In this lesson, I learned the basics of how data is sent and received on the web, how URLs work, and how to obtain data for use in my application. Along the way, I built a Playground that uses a URLSession to fetch and display a photo. In future lessons, I'll learn how to convert the data I get from the web into custom model data, where to place the code that makes network requests, and best practices for displaying web data in my app.

## What I Learned
- How data is sent and received on the web.
- How URLs work and how to construct a URL with query parameters.
- How to download data from the web.
- How to print downloaded data to the console.

## Vocabulary
- `actors`: Entities that perform actions in a concurrent system.
- `API`: Application Programming Interface, a set of rules that allows two software programs to communicate with each other.
- `asynchronous`: Operation that doesn't block the main thread of execution.
- `async`: Keyword indicating an asynchronous function in Swift.
- `await`: Keyword that suspends execution until an asynchronous operation completes.
- `GET`: HTTP request method used to retrieve data from the server.
- `HTML`: Markup language used to create web pages.
- `HTTP header`: Additional information sent in an HTTP request or response.
- `JSON`: JavaScript Object Notation, a data interchange format.
- `POST`: HTTP request method used to send data to the server.
- `query`: Parameter in a URL that specifies the data sent to the server.
- `query item`: Key-value pair that is part of a URL.
- `queue`: Data structure that manages the execution of tasks in a specific order.
- `synchronous`: Operation that blocks the main thread of execution until completed.
- `thread`: Sequence of instructions that can be executed concurrently.
- `tuple type`: Data type that can contain multiple heterogeneous values.
- `URL`: Uniform Resource Locator, an address that identifies a resource on the internet.
- `URLSession`: Swift class for performing networking tasks.
- `User-Agent`: HTTP header that identifies the client software making the request.
- `web server`: Program that serves web content over the internet.
