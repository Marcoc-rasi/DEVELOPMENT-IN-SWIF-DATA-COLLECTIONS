# Working with the Web

In this lesson, I have learned about collection views, compositional layouts, diffable data sources, Swift generics, and user notifications. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, Habits, an application that allows users to track good habits by recording them on a social network. The application uses a web service to simulate user activity on the social network, and I have had the ability to customize the habits and simulated users.

## Swift Lessons
- `Closures`: Executable code blocks at specific moments.
- `Extensions`: Techniques to extend the functionality of existing types.

## SDK Lessons
- `Practical Animation`: Practical application of animations in the user interface.
- `Working with the Web: HTTP and URL Session`: Understanding how web requests work.
- `Working with the Web: JSON`: Processing and using JSON data from the web.
- `Working with the Web: Concurrency`: Efficiently handling concurrent operations.

## What I Built
The Restaurant application allows users to explore a customizable menu that retrieves information from a web service. I can customize the entire menu with my own dishes, descriptions, prices, and photos that will appear in the application.
