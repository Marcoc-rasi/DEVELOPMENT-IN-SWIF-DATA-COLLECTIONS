# Working with the Web

In this lesson, I have learned about application personality, animations, concurrency, and working with the web. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, Restaurant, a customizable menu application that displays a restaurant's available dishes and allows the user to place an order. This app uses a web service that allows students to configure the menu with their own items and photos.

## Swift Lessons
- `Closures`: Executable code blocks at specific moments.
- `Extensions`: Techniques to extend the functionality of existing types.

## SDK Lessons
- `Practical Animation`: Practical application of animations in the user interface.
- `Working with the Web: HTTP and URL Session`: Understanding how web requests work.
- `Working with the Web: JSON`: Processing and using JSON data from the web.
- `Working with the Web: Concurrency`: Efficiently handling concurrent operations.

## What I Built
The Restaurant application allows users to explore a customizable menu that retrieves information from a web service. I can customize the entire menu with my own dishes, descriptions, prices, and photos that will appear in the application.
