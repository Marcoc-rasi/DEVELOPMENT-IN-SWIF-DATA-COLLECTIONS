# `Working with the Web`

In this lesson, I've learned about app personality, animations, concurrency, and working with the web. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, Restaurant, a customizable menu application that displays available dishes from a restaurant and allows the user to place an order. This application uses a web service that enables students to configure the menu with their own items and photos.

## `Swift Lessons`
- `Closures`: Executable code blocks at specific moments.
- `Extensions`: Techniques for extending the functionality of existing types.

## `SDK Lessons`
- `Practical Animation`: Practical application of animations in the user interface.
- `Working with the Web: HTTP and URL Session`: Understanding how web requests function.
- `Working with the Web: JSON`: Processing and utilizing JSON data from the web.
- `Working with the Web: Concurrency`: Handling concurrent operations efficiently.

## `Application Videos and Explanation`

### `Guided Project – Restaurant - OrderApp`

In this project, networking, JSON, concurrency, and closures in Swift were utilized to build a client application for a web API that provides a list of menu items for a restaurant. It features an interactive menu, allowing customers to view a list of options, add items to an order, and submit that order to the restaurant.

### `Project OrderApp Extension - State Restoration`

In the project extension, you will add the ability for the OrderApp application to remember its state. This means that if the user stops the application and returns later, the application will remember where it was. To achieve this, you will use a tool called NSUserActivity, which essentially stores key information about the user's current order. This "state" will be saved in a specific part of the application called MenuController. So, when the user reopens the application, it will start exactly from where they left off.

## `Unit 2 - Working With The Web`

### `Lesson 2.3 – Animations`

#### `Contest - Lab`

The application allows users to enter their email address to participate in a contest and win a prize. If they try to submit without providing an email address, the application uses animations to highlight the text field and alert the user that it needs to be filled out to participate in the contest.

#### `MusicWireframe. Lesson app`

The application is a wireframe (a basic outline, without real functionality) of the "Now Playing" screen in the music app.

### `Lesson 2.6 - WWW Concurrency`

#### `iTunesSearch – Lab`

The goal of this lab is to integrate iTunes search network requests into a table view.

#### `SpacePhoto – Lesson app`

An app that uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to fetch data and display information along with the image within the application.
