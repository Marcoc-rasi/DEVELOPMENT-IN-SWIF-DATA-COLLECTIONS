### `BasicCollectionView`

In this lesson, you'll learn how to organize data in a grid using the basic building blocks for collection views and a simple compositional layout.

The provided code is an implementation of a collection view controller in an iOS application. In this code, a `class` named `BasicCollectionViewController` is defined, which inherits from the `UICollectionViewController` class. This `class` is responsible for being managed by a collection view in the user interface.

The collection view is configured to display a list of `state names` in the United States, which are stored in a `private constant` called `items`. This constant contains an array of strings that represents the `state names`.

The `class` `BasicCollectionViewCell` is used to customize the appearance of the cells in the collection view. This `class` is a subclass of `UICollectionViewCell` and contains a property called `label`, which is an instance of the `UILabel` class. The `label` is declared as an `interface outlet` using the `@IBOutlet` attribute, suggesting that it will be connected to a `label` in the user interface file.

In the `viewDidLoad` method of the `BasicCollectionViewController` `class`, the layout of the collection view is configured using a method called `generateLayout`. The layout of the collection view is set using a `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`, which specifies the structure of the view, including `items`, `groups`, and `sections`. In this case, a layout with a single column and fixed-height cells is created.

The `numberOfItemsInSection` method is used to determine the `number of items` to be displayed in the collection view. It returns the `number of items` in the `items` array.

The `cellForItemAt` method is responsible for providing the cells to be displayed in the collection view. A reusable cell identified by `reuseIdentifier` is obtained, and the `text` from the `items` array is assigned to the `text` property of the `label` in the custom cell.

In summary, this code creates a collection view that displays a list of `state names` in custom cells. Customization of the cells is achieved through the `BasicCollectionViewCell` `class`, which contains a `label` to display the text. The structure of the collection view is defined in the `generateLayout` method, and a `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` is used to apply the layout.
