# `Collection Views`

In this lesson, I learned how to organize data in a grid using the basic building blocks for collection views and a simple compositional layout.

## `What I Learned`

- Identify apps or components within apps that may have been implemented with a collection view
- Describe proper use cases for displaying data in collection views
- Provide data to a collection view
- Create prototype cells in Interface Builder
- Use a basic compositional layout
- Describe when to use simple or complex compositional layouts


## `Vocabulary`
- `collection view`: A UI component that organizes and displays content in a grid.
- `collection view cell`: An individual element in a collection view that displays specific information.
- `collection view layout`: A layout that defines the appearance and organization of cells in a collection view.
- `compositional layout`: A design approach that uses modular building blocks to create flexible and reusable layouts.
- `flow layout`: A type of collection view layout that organizes cells in a linear sequence.

### `EmojiDictionary`

In this lab, you will apply what you learned in a previous project on table views: EmojiDictionary. This time, you'll implement it using a collection view instead of a table view.
