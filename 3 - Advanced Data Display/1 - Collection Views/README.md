# Collection Views

Now that I'm familiar with displaying data in lists using UITableView, what about other layouts? That's where UICollectionView comes in. Collection views allow organizing content in a simple scrollable grid or in more complex custom layouts to fit the style and needs of my application.

I don't need to look far to find examples of collection views in iOS. The design of the iOS home screen, with its grids of app icons and folders, is an example of what can be achieved with collection views.

In this lesson, I learned how to organize data in a grid using the basic building blocks for collection views and a simple compositional layout. In an upcoming lesson, I'll learn to create more complex custom layouts for well-organized and appealing apps.

## What I Learned
- When to use collection views.
- How to provide data to a collection view.
- How to create a prototype collection view cell in Interface Builder.
