# Working with the Web

Most applications connect to web services to retrieve or send information used in the application. In this unit, I learned how to create and send network requests to send and receive data.

To begin with, I explored `closures`, which are code blocks that can be used as variables and allow writing code that will be executed at a later time. I used `closures` to write code that would run after network requests finish. I also learned to use `closures` to work with collections and create animations in my application.

Next, I worked through three lessons that explained how the web works, how to request information from a web service, how to convert that information into structures or classes that I can use in my application, and how to make my application work smoothly with long-running network operations.

## Swift Lessons
- `Closures`: Executable code blocks at specific moments.
- `Extensions`: Techniques to extend the functionality of existing types.

## SDK Lessons
- `Practical Animation`: Practical application of animations in the user interface.
- `Working with the Web: HTTP and URL Session`: Understanding how web requests work.
- `Working with the Web: JSON`: Processing and using JSON data from the web.
- `Working with the Web: Concurrency`: Efficiently handling concurrent operations.

## What I Built
The Restaurant application allows users to explore a customizable menu that retrieves information from a web service. I can customize the entire menu with my own dishes, descriptions, prices, and photos that will appear in the application.
