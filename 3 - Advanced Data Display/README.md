# Advanced Data Visualization

In this lesson, I have learned about collection views, compositional layouts, diffable data sources, Swift generics, and user notifications. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, Habits, an application that allows users to track good habits by recording them on a social network. The application uses a web service to simulate user activity on the social network, and I have had the ability to customize the habits and simulated users.

## Swift Lessons
- `Swift Generics`: Powerful functionality for creating reusable and flexible code.

## SDK Lessons
- `Collection Views`: Fundamentals and advanced capabilities.
- `Dynamic Data`: Handling dynamically changing data.
- `Composite Layout`: Creating complex and adaptable layouts.
- `Advanced Layout`: Advanced strategies for data presentation.

## What I Built
The Habits application allows users to track good habits by logging them in a social network. I connected to a web service to retrieve information shared by users of the service and kept my application updated as data changed. I could customize the habits I track and the simulated users of the network.
