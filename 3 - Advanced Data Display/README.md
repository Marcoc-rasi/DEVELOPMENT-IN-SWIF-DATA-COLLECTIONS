# `Advanced Data Display`

In this lesson, I've learned about collection views, compositional layouts, diffable data sources, Swift generics, and user notifications. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, Habits, an application that allows users to track good habits by recording them on a social network. The application uses a web service to simulate user activity on the social network, and I've had the ability to customize habits and simulated users.

## `Swift Lessons`
- `Swift Generics`: Powerful functionality for creating reusable and flexible code.

## `SDK Lessons`
- `Collection Views`: Fundamentals and advanced capabilities.
- `Dynamic Data`: Handling dynamically changing data.
- `Composite Design`: Creating complex and adaptable layouts.
- `Advanced Layout`: Advanced strategies for data presentation.

## `Application Videos and Explanation`

### `Guided Project - Habits`

The application addresses various practical aspects. It uses collection views to display data sets, implements generics in Swift, employs diffable data sources for facilitating dynamic updates, and explores compositional layouts to create advanced interfaces.

The app focuses on being a client for a social network that motivates users to adopt good habits by comparing their rankings with other users. The app makes use of a local server, with a particular emphasis on the user interface design. App data is provided in advance, along with a simulation modeling user interaction with the app over time.

## `Unit 3 - Advanced Data Display`

### `Lesson 3.1 - Collection Views`

#### `EmojiDictionary – Lab`

EmojiDictionary App, this time utilizing a collection view instead of a table view.

#### `BasicCollectionView – Lesson App`

An app for organizing data in a grid using basic building blocks for collection views and a simple compositional layout.

### `Lesson 3.2 - Swift Generics`

#### `Life-formSearch – Lab`

I have developed an application that simplifies the search and visualization of taxonomic information and photos of life forms. The app uses the Encyclopedia of Life's data services API to access and display information about identified life forms.

### `Lesson 3.3 - Dynamic Data`

#### `iTunesSearch – Lab`

In this lab, I applied my new knowledge of collection views, search controllers, and diffable data sources to enhance the iTunes Search solution (Part 3). I refactored the existing solution, using a custom view controller that allows switching between two view controllers. Additionally, I updated the use of a search controller instead of a search bar to improve functionality.

#### `BasicCollectionView – Lesson App`

The app uses the `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource` API to provide data to a collection view, offering standard features such as automatic change animation.

### `Lesson 3.4 - Compositional Layout`

#### `Compositional Layout lab`

In the Emoji Dictionary app, grid and column layouts were added, a function to switch between them, and simple section headers were included.

### `Lesson 3.5 - Advanced Layout`

#### `iTunesSearch – Lab`

In this update of the iTunes Search Lab solution (Part 4), I added a new search scope that spans the existing four scopes (Movies, Music, Apps, and Books). Results are grouped into sections for clear separation.

#### `AppStoreLayout – Lesson App`

I built a replica of the iOS App Store's home page using a single collection view and a compositional layout with distinct sections.

### `Lesson 3.6 - Local Notifications`

#### `BillManager – Lab`

BillManager allows users to track pending bills and mark them as paid or pending; local notifications were added to remind users of pending payments.

#### `Alarm – Lesson App`

This project consists of the basic structure of a simple alarm application that allows creating one alarm at a time. I implemented the logic to create an alarm, obtain authorization for sending notifications, schedule local notifications, and offer users the option to snooze their alarm.
