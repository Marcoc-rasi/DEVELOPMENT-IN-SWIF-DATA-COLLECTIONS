# Advanced Data Visualization

You use applications that scroll through collections of information every day. When iOS was first introduced, table views were the main interface for viewing this type of data. But things have changed a lot since those early days. Modern applications are much more complex and capable, requiring a greater variety of ways to present information than simple scrolling lists. Modern applications display data collections in various ways to provide users with efficient and intuitive interfaces.

In this unit, I learned all about collection views—the best way to create complex and adaptable layouts to display a large amount of information.

To start, I understood the basics of collection views and the similarities and differences between them and table views. Next, I took a quick look at a Swift language feature called `generics`, a powerful way to create reusable and flexible code.

Then, I worked through three lessons that took me through the capabilities of collection views and composite layouts—the standard way to define how a collection view displays data. Along the way, I learned about diffable data sources, allowing me to keep my collection view updated with changing data without the complications of delegate callbacks that I learned in the previous unit. In the last lesson, I delved into user notifications, a key iOS feature that many applications use to keep users informed when they are not running.

## Swift Lessons
- `Swift Generics`: Powerful functionality for creating reusable and flexible code.

## SDK Lessons
- `Collection Views`: Fundamentals and advanced capabilities.
- `Dynamic Data`: Handling dynamically changing data.
- `Composite Layout`: Creating complex and adaptable layouts.
- `Advanced Layout`: Advanced strategies for data presentation.

## What I Built
The Habits application allows users to track good habits by logging them in a social network. I connected to a web service to retrieve information shared by users of the service and kept my application updated as data changed. I could customize the habits I track and the simulated users of the network.
