# Compositional Layout

You have used compositional layouts with collection views in previous lessons, but you haven't really explored their capabilities. Compositional layouts for collection views are powerful tools. They allow you to break down a layout into small components and assemble them into larger groups with a simple set of rules, and their API is general enough to cover a wide range of user interfaces for displaying large data collections.
In this lesson, you will learn more about how compositional layouts work and get to know supplementary views, which allow you to add a rich layer of design to any collection view.

## What I Learned
- How the elements, groups, and sections of compositional layouts work together.
- How to use supplementary views.

## Vocabulary
- `absolute size`: The exact size of an element or group in a compositional layout.
- `decoration`: Additional visual elements that can be added to a compositional layout to enhance aesthetics.
- `dimension`: The size measurement of an element or group in a compositional layout, which can be absolute or fractional.
- `estimated size`: An approximation of the size of an element or group in a compositional layout.
- `fractional size`: The relative size of an element or group in a compositional layout, expressed as a fraction of the container.
- `group`: A logical unit of elements within a compositional layout.
- `item`: An individual component within a compositional layout.
- `section`: A logical grouping of elements or groups within a compositional layout.
- `supplementary item`: An additional visual element that can be added to a compositional layout to provide additional information or enhance appearance.

The provided code comprises several components that come together to create an application for managing a collection of emojis. The application is composed of three main classes: `EmojiCollectionViewHeader`, `EmojiCollectionViewController`, and `AddEditEmojiTableViewController`. It also utilizes two structures, `Emoji` and `Section`, to model and organize emojis. Below, we will explain how these parts combine to create the overall functionality of the application.

Firstly, the `Emoji` structure is defined. This structure represents an emoji and stores its core attributes such as the "symbol," "name," "description," and "usage." Additionally, a computed property called "sectionTitle" is dynamically calculated and used to organize emojis into sections based on the initial letter of their names.

The `Section` structure is employed to group emojis into sections with a "title" that identifies the section.

Next, the `EmojiCollectionViewHeader` class is implemented, which extends `UICollectionReusableView`. This class is responsible for creating headers with visual effects for each section in the emoji collection view. The `EmojiCollectionViewHeader` class includes a `UILabel` named "titleLabel" that displays the section's title.

The main class of the application is `EmojiCollectionViewController`, which is a view controller inheriting from `UICollectionViewController`. This class manages the collection view that displays the emojis. The controller is initialized with a set of predefined emojis, which are stored in an array. The collection view is organized based on the current layout, which can be either a "grid" or a "column."

The collection view employs two different layouts generated by the `generateGridLayout` and `generateColumnLayout` methods. These methods configure the structure of the collection view, setting up items, groups, and sections, as well as margins and spacing between items.

Emoji editing is handled through the `AddEditEmojiTableViewController` class. This class allows users to add new emojis or edit existing ones. The text fields in this view correspond to the emoji attributes, such as "symbol," "name," "description," and "usage." The "Save" button is automatically enabled or disabled based on certain conditions, such as the presence of a single emoji in the symbol field and the non-empty state of the text fields.

Additionally, the `textEditingChanged` function is implemented to track changes in the text fields and update the state of the "Save" button.

The application also allows users to delete emojis via a contextual menu, configured in the `contextMenuConfigurationForItemAt` method. Emoji deletion is performed in the `deleteEmoji` method.

In summary, the application manages a collection of emojis in a collection view, organizes emojis into sections, enables the addition and editing of emojis, and provides the option to delete emojis via a contextual menu. The data structure is based on the `Emoji` and `Section` classes, and the user interface is controlled through the `EmojiCollectionViewController` and `AddEditEmojiTableViewController` classes.
