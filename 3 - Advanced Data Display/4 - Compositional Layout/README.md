# Compositional Layout

You've used compositional layouts with collection views in previous lessons, but you haven't really explored their capabilities. Collection view compositional layouts are powerful tools. They allow you to break down a layout into small components and assemble them into larger groups with a simple set of rules, and their API is general enough to cover a wide range of user interfaces for displaying large collections of data.

In this lesson, you'll learn more about how compositional layouts work and get to know supplementary views, which allow you to add a rich layer of design to any collection view.

## What I Learned
- How elements, groups, and sections of compositional layouts work together.
- How to use supplementary views.

## Vocabulary
- **Absolute Size**: The exact size of an item or group in a compositional layout.
- **Decoration**: Additional visual elements that can be added to a compositional layout to enhance aesthetics.
- **Dimension**: The size measurement of an item or group in a compositional layout, which can be absolute or fractional.
- **Estimated Size**: An approximation of the size of an item or group in a compositional layout.
- **Fractional Size**: The relative size of an item or group in a compositional layout, expressed as a fraction of the container.
- **Group**: A logical unit of items within a compositional layout.
- **Item**: An individual component within a compositional layout.
- **Section**: A logical grouping of items or groups within a compositional layout.
- **Supplementary Item**: An additional visual element that can be added to a compositional layout to provide additional information or enhance appearance.
