# `Compositional Layout`

In previous lessons, I have used compositional layouts with collection views, but I have not fully explored their capabilities. Collection view compositional layouts are powerful tools. They allow a design to be decomposed into small components that can be assembled into larger groups with a simple set of rules, and their API is general enough to span a wide variety of user interfaces for displaying large collections of data.

In this lesson, I've delved into how compositional layouts work and supplemental views, which allow me to add a rich layer of layout to any collection view.

## `What I Learned`

- Describe how items, groups, and sections of compositional layouts work together
- Use supplementary views in collection views


## `Vocabulary`
- `absolute size`: The exact size of an element or group in a compositional layout.
- `decoration`: Additional visual elements that can be added to a compositional layout to enhance aesthetics.
- `dimension`: The size measurement of an element or group in a compositional layout, which can be absolute or fractional.
- `estimated size`: An approximation of the size of an element or group in a compositional layout.
- `fractional size`: The relative size of an element or group in a compositional layout, expressed as a fraction of the container.
- `group`: A logical unit of elements within a compositional layout.
- `item`: An individual component within a compositional layout.
- `section`: A logical grouping of elements or groups within a compositional layout.
- `supplementary item`: An additional visual element that can be added to a compositional layout to provide additional information or enhance appearance.

### `Compositional Layout lab`

In this lab, I have applied my knowledge and skills to evolve the Emoji Dictionary project. I've implemented grid and column layouts, a feature to switch between them, and added simple section headers.
