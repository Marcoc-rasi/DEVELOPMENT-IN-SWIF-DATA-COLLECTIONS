# Swift Generics

An important design principle of the Swift programming language is progressive disclosure: the practice of revealing concepts over time as the user gains experience and confidence, rather than all at once. For example, you can use Swift as a beginner without understanding anything about protocols, even though you are using protocols every time you use even basic types like Int or String.

Generics are another example of progressive disclosure. They are a powerful feature of Swift, but to use them, you should feel comfortable with the fundamentals of the language. Like any new concept, generics may seem confusing at first, but you've already mastered all the necessary concepts to start exploring them. By the end of this unit, you'll be using generics to make your projects more readable and maintainable.

## What I Learned
- How to identify generic types and methods by their syntax.
- How to use generics to make code reusable.
- How to use generics in conjunction with protocols.
- How to use associated types with protocols.

## Vocabulary
- `associated type`: A type associated with a protocol that is specified when adopting the protocol.
- `syntactic sugar`: Simplified syntax that makes the code more readable and concise.
- `type alias`: An alternative name that can be given to an existing type.
- `type parameter`: A type used as a placeholder to represent specific types when using a generic type.
