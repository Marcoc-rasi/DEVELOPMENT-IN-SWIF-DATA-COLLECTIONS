# `Swift Generics`

Generics are a powerful tool in Swift. They may seem confusing at first, but once you get familiar with the basics of the language, they become a fantastic way to make your projects more readable and maintainable. After mastering the concepts, you realize that generics are a great help in writing cleaner, abstract, and reusable code. They really make programming much more efficient and elegant!

## `What I Learned`

- Understand the benefits of generics
- Identify generic types and methods based on the syntax of their definition
- Understand how protocols and generics work together
- Understand the benefits of protocols with associated types


## `Vocabulary`
- `associated type`: A type associated with a protocol that is specified when adopting the protocol.
- `syntactic sugar`: Simplified syntax that makes the code more readable and concise.
- `type alias`: An alternative name that can be given to an existing type.
- `type parameter`: A type used as a placeholder to represent specific types when using a generic type.

### `Life-formSearch`

In this lab, I have built an application that makes it easy for users to search for life forms and view available taxonomic information and photos. Applying what I learned in this lesson and previous lessons, I have created an app that uses the data services API of the Encyclopedia of Life (www.eol.org) to explore its database and obtain information about life forms. identified.
