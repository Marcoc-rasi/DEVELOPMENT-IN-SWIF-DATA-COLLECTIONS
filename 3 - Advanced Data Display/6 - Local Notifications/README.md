# `Local Notifications`

Notifications are an essential part of the iOS experience, allowing apps to communicate with their users even when they are closed. I have learned about the UserNotifications framework and how to schedule and manage local notifications.

## `What I Learned`

- Understand the difference between local and remote notifications
- Configure an app to receive local notifications
- Schedule local notifications that use varying combinations of badging, alerts, and sounds
- Create a notification category with two different actions that a user can take
- Create a notification that takes text input as a response from the user


## `Vocabulary`
- `actionable notification`: A notification that allows the user to perform actions directly from the notification.
- `badge`: A number or symbol that appears on the app icon to indicate the presence of new notifications or messages.
- `banner`: A common way to present notifications at the top of the screen.
- `local notification`: A notification that is scheduled and displayed on the user's device.
- `notification category`: A classification that allows the user to manage how notifications are presented.
- `remote notification`: A notification sent from a remote server to a device.

### `BillManager`

I extended the BillManager project in the resources folder. Currently, BillManager allows users to track outstanding invoices and mark them as paid or pending. My task was to add local notifications to remind users of pending payments.

### `Alarm`

This project consists of the basic structure of a simple alarm application that allows you to create one alarm at a time. I've implemented logic to create an alarm, get authorization to send notifications, schedule local notifications, and give users the option to snooze their alarm.
