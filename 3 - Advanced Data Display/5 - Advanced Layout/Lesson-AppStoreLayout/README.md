### `AppStoreLayout`

In this lesson, I built a replica of the iOS App Store home page using a single collection view and a compositional layout with distinct sections. The focus of this lesson is on creating compositional layout and reinforcing my knowledge of `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`.

The code is composed of multiple classes and structures in the Swift programming language, and it uses the iOS UIKit framework to create a user interface. The primary purpose of the code is to define the appearance and behavior of a collection view that displays a list of apps and categories from an app store.

- **`App` and `StoreCategory`**: These two structures define the data models for apps and store categories. Each `App` instance contains information about an app, such as title, subtitle, price, and a possible promotional headline. Apps also have a random color for their visual representation. On the other hand, categories are represented by a name and a random color.

- **`Item`**: The `Item` enumeration is used to represent both apps and categories. This structure allows for storing objects of type `App` or `StoreCategory`. It also provides methods to access specific data for an app or category, as appropriate.

- **`PromotedAppCollectionViewCell` and `StandardAppCollectionViewCell`**: These classes define custom cells for the collection view that display apps. `PromotedAppCollectionViewCell` cells are designed to highlight promoted apps, featuring headers, titles, subtitles, and app images. `StandardAppCollectionViewCell` cells present standard apps with titles, subtitles, and images. Additionally, these cells can display a bottom line to separate the cells in the collection view.

- **`CategoryCollectionViewCell`**: This class defines a custom cell for displaying categories in the collection view. Each cell contains a representative category image, a title, and a possible bottom line. Category images and titles are configured based on the corresponding category.

- **`SectionHeaderView` and `LineView`**: These classes represent header views and horizontal lines used in the collection view. `SectionHeaderView` displays a title and a "See All" button in a horizontal layout. `LineView` displays horizontal gray lines used to separate sections in the collection view.

- **`ViewController`**: The `ViewController` class is the main view controller that manages the collection view and its data. In `ViewController`, the collection view is configured, and custom cells, headers, and lines are registered. Additionally, the layout of the collection view, how sections are organized, and how data is displayed are defined. The collection view's data controller is configured to provide and update data as you scroll through the collection view.

Overall, the code focuses on creating a highly customized collection view that displays apps and categories from an app store. Each user interface component is tailored to its specific function, and custom cells and header/views are used to achieve the desired presentation. The `App` and `StoreCategory` structures are used to store app and category data, and the `Item` enumeration provides a unified way to represent this data in the collection view.
