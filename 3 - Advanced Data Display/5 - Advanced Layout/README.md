# `Advanced Compositional Layouts`

In this lesson, I learned how to build compositional layouts for collection views that allow data to be displayed in ways that the flow layout does not support. The focus is on building applications that present data in distinct groups and sections. Additionally, I have gained valuable refactoring skills during the hands-on lab portion of the lesson.

## `What I Learned`

- Use `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` to create complex layouts, including sections with distinct layouts
- Describe the three components of a compositional layout
- Use `UICollectionLayoutSectionOrthogonalScrollingBehavior` to make sections scroll orthogonally to the main layout
- Use supplementary views to add headers and other items to layout sections



## `Vocabulary`
- `anchor`: A reference point used to position elements within a compositional layout.
- `layout environment`: The context in which the layout is being created, which includes information about the size and other attributes of the environment.
- `MARK comment`: A special comment used to divide and organize the source code.
- `orthogonal`: Related to lines or sections perpendicular to each other in a design; in this context, it refers to sections with perpendicular scrolling.

### `iTunesSearch`

In this update to the iTunes Search Lab solution (Part 4), I've added a new search scope that spans all four existing scopes (Movies, Music, Apps, and Books). The results have been grouped into sections for clear separation.

### `AppStoreLayout`

In this lesson, I built a replica of the iOS App Store home page using a single collection view and a compositional layout with distinct sections. The focus of this lesson is on creating compositional layout and reinforcing my knowledge of `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`.
