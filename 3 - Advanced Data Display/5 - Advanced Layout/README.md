# Advanced Compositional Layouts

You have learned that collection views are a flexible tool for displaying data collections in different ways, and you have learned how to create basic lists and grids using compositional layouts. This is a good start, but you can do much more. In this lesson, you will learn how to make the most of the capabilities of compositional layouts to create richer interfaces that provide an excellent user experience.

## What I Learned
- How to create sections with different layouts.
- How to create sections with orthogonal scrolling in a compositional layout.

## Vocabulary
- `anchor`: A reference point used to position elements within a compositional layout.
- `layout environment`: The context in which the layout is being created, which includes information about the size and other attributes of the environment.
- `MARK comment`: A special comment used to divide and organize the source code.
- `orthogonal`: Related to lines or sections perpendicular to each other in a design; in this context, it refers to sections with perpendicular scrolling.
