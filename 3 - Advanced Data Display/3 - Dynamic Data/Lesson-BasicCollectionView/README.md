### `BasicCollectionView`

In this lesson, I learned about my first API that uses generics: `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`. I understood how it can reduce the work required to provide data to a collection view by offering standard features, such as animation of changes, automatically.

In the provided code snippet, an implementation of a collection view (UICollectionView) in an iOS development environment using the Swift language is presented. This collection view displays a list of United States states and provides real-time search functionality.

The United States states are defined as a constant array named `items`, which contains all the state names. This is relevant as the data is based on this array and is used for both searching and displaying within the collection view.

A class named `BasicCollectionViewController` has been created, which inherits from `UICollectionViewController` and adopts the `UISearchResultsUpdating` protocol. In this class, key functionalities are implemented, such as search bar management and data presentation within the collection view.

The search bar is managed by a search controller named `searchController`, configured not to obscure the background during result presentation. This is crucial to ensure that search results are visible to the user. Furthermore, the option to keep the search bar visible even when the user scrolls the collection view is enabled (`navigationItem.hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling = false`).

The `createDataSource` method is responsible for setting up a `dataSource` object of type `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource` to manage the data in the collection view. This is relevant for presenting the elements within the collection view.

The `updateSearchResults` function is executed whenever a search is performed. Search results are filtered based on the text entered into the search bar and applied to the collection view. This update is done with animation to provide a smooth user experience.

The layout of the collection view is defined in the `generateLayout` method. In this layout, the size of items, spacing between them, and other visual aspects are defined. This layout adapts to the content of the collection view and ensures that items are displayed appropriately.

Finally, an additional class named `BasicCollectionViewCell` is defined, which inherits from `UICollectionViewCell`. This class contains a label (`label`) used to display the text of the states in each cell of the collection view. The `label` property is annotated with the `@IBOutlet` attribute, allowing it to be connected to a label in the user interface. This is crucial for customizing the appearance of cells in the collection view.

In summary, the provided code creates an iOS collection view that displays a list of United States states and allows users to search for specific states. The implementation is based on search bar configuration, data management, and customization of the collection view cells. Data is stored in a constant array, filtered based on the search, and efficiently presented within the collection view.
