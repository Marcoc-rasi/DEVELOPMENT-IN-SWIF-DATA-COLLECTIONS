### `iTunesSearch`

In this lab, I applied my new knowledge of collection views, search controllers, and fuzzy data sources to update the iTunes Search solution (Part 3). I started with a refactored version of the solution, available in the resources folder. The solution has been enhanced to use a custom view controller, allowing me to switch between the views of two view controllers. (Standard UIKit container view controllers include UINavigationController and UITabBarController.) It has also been updated to use a search controller instead of a search bar.

The code presents a set of classes and structures designed for implementing an iOS application for searching and displaying items from a store, possibly linked to the iTunes store. Several key components in this code stand out, all contributing to the overall functionality of the application.

Firstly, the `StoreItemListTableViewController` class is defined, inheriting from `UITableViewController`. This class handles the logic related to displaying a list of items in a table. The `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)` method is used to manage the selection of a row in the table and to deselect it with animation.

The `StoreItemController` class is crucial in obtaining data and managing images for store items. It contains a set of asynchronous methods to interact with a web API and retrieve information, as well as images associated with store items. Custom errors are defined in the `StoreItemError` enumeration to handle situations where items cannot be found or image information is missing.

In the code, the `UISearchResultsUpdating` protocol is used, and the `StoreItemContainerViewController` class is defined. This class, inheriting from `UIViewController`, serves as the main controller that manages the user interface for searching and displaying store items. Within the class, views are configured, including a table view and a collection view, along with a search controller (`UISearchController`) that allows users to search for items in the store.

Data sources (`tableViewDataSource` and `collectionViewDataSource`) are defined for the table view and the collection view, respectively, and are kept in sync with updated data. Asynchronous tasks for loading images and canceling ongoing tasks are managed, ensuring efficient application performance.

The `StoreItem` class is a structure that represents a store item and is used to decode item information obtained through a network request. The use of `Codable` allows for mapping JSON keys to structure properties, and a custom initializer is provided to handle cases where not all fields are present in the JSON data.

The `SearchResponse` structure is used to represent the response from a search, which is an array of store items. Both the `StoreItem` and `SearchResponse` structures are crucial for processing data related to store items in the application.

Finally, the `ItemTableViewCell` and `ItemCollectionViewCell` classes are defined, which are custom cells used to display store item information in a table view and a collection view, respectively. Both classes inherit from standard cells and conform to the `ItemDisplaying` protocol. The protocol defines properties used to display item information, such as the title, details, and the image.

Within the extensions of these classes, the `configure(for item: StoreItem, storeItemController: StoreItemController) async` method is implemented, which is responsible for configuring the cell with item information and managing the asynchronous downloading of images. This method is essential for efficiently displaying data in custom cells.

Together, these classes and structures form the foundation of an application that allows users to search and view store items, with the ability to load images and efficiently manage asynchronous tasks. The code provides a solid structure for implementing this functionality, covering data management through to user interface presentation.
