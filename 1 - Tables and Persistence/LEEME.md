# Tables and Persistence

With my current knowledge of Xcode, Swift, and UIKit, I begin to visualize the creation of various types of applications. In this unit, I explored three important sets of techniques in application development that, when combined, allowed me to build much more complex applications.

Firstly, I understood how to use tables to display lists of information and applied the master-detail design pattern to facilitate my interaction with the information.

Secondly, I organized files, structures, and classes in my applications to optimize my work and that of other developers in the future.

Thirdly, I discovered an approach to save data on the device, ensuring that any information I entered or modified in my application would be available the next time I opened the application.

By the end of this unit, I felt comfortable building many useful applications that displayed diverse information and allowed users to input, edit, and save data in the application.

## Swift Lessons
- `Protocols`: A set of rules that defined how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

## SDK Lessons
- `Application Lifecycle`: I understood how an application started, ran, and terminated.
- `Model-View-Controller`: I organized my code following this fundamental design pattern.
- `Scroll Views`: I implemented views that allowed content scrolling.
- `Table Views`: I used tables to display structured information.
- `Intermediate Table Views`: I delved into advanced table handling.
- `System View Controllers`: I understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- `Data Persistence`: I explored methods for storing information persistently.
- `Complex Input Screens`: I applied techniques to create complex user interfaces.

## What I Built
List was a task-tracking application that allowed me to add, edit, and delete tasks in a familiar master-detail interface. I customized the application to track any type of information, such as a collection of cards or my favorite movies.
