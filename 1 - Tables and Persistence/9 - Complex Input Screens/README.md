# Complex Input Screens

In this lesson, I learned how to use standard user interface controls to build a data entry interface with complex input forms.

## What I Learned

- Demonstrate how to build complex workflows with complex controls
- Demonstrate how to use a custom protocol and delegate for passing data between view controllers
- Demonstrate how to use `UITableViewDelegate` methods to dynamically resize table cells
- Demonstrate how to use a date picker in a table view controller
- Demonstrate how to use a static table view to create a form


## Vocabulary
- `AnyObject`: Protocol type that represents an object of any type.
- `date formatting`: Process of adjusting the presentation of a date according to a specific format.

## `9 - Complex Input Screens`

### `EmployeeRoster`

The goal of this lab is to create a display that accepts complex user input. A date picker and custom delegate will be used to build an employee registry that keeps track of employee information.
