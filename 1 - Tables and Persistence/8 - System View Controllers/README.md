# System View Controllers

In this lesson, I learned about the most common system view controllers and how to use them to present alerts, send messages, share content, and access the camera roll.

## What I Learned

- Demonstrate how to present an alert controller and respond to user choices
- Demonstrate how to present an activity view controller
- Demonstrate how to present a mail compose view controller
- Demonstrate how to present an image picker view controller and use the selected image
- Demonstrate how to present a Safari view controller to present a website

## Vocabulary
- `activity view controller`: System controller that allows the user to perform activities like sharing content.
- `alert controller`: System controller that displays alert or action messages to the user.
- `handler`: Function that runs in response to a specific action.
- `image picker controller`: System controller that allows the user to select images from the camera or photo library.
- `mail composition view controller`: System controller that allows the user to compose and send emails.
- `system view controller`: Subclasses of `UIViewController` provided by UIKit for specific functions, such as sharing content or displaying alerts.

### `HomeFurniture`

The goal of this lab is to use system view controllers in an application that lists rooms and furniture, allowing users to share furniture items with other applications on their device. Be sure to build and run the app on a physical iOS device, rather than the simulator, to have more apps that support image and text sharing.

### `SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi`

The application integrates several key functionalities to interact with the device and perform actions such as sharing images, viewing websites, taking photos and sending emails.

### `Challenge SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi`

The application uses the UIKit framework to create a user interface with several buttons, each of which performs different actions. These actions include sharing an image, opening a website in Safari, taking a photo with the device's camera, sending an email, and sending a text message.
