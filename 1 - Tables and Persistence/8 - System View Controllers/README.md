# System View Controllers

Up to this point in the course, I've been creating my own subclasses of `UIViewController` to display information in my apps. But UIKit includes several subclasses of `UIViewController` that make it easy to present, access, and share app content.

In this lesson, I learned how to incorporate these system view controllers to display alerts, share content, send messages, and access the camera and photo library on an iOS device.

## What I Learned
- How to present an activity view controller.
- How to present a Safari view controller.
- How to present and respond to actions in an alert controller.
- How to access and respond to selections in an image picker controller.
- How to present a mail composition view controller.

## Vocabulary
- `activity view controller`: System controller that allows the user to perform activities like sharing content.
- `alert controller`: System controller that displays alert or action messages to the user.
- `handler`: Function that runs in response to a specific action.
- `image picker controller`: System controller that allows the user to select images from the camera or photo library.
- `mail composition view controller`: System controller that allows the user to compose and send emails.
- `system view controller`: Subclasses of `UIViewController` provided by UIKit for specific functions, such as sharing content or displaying alerts.
