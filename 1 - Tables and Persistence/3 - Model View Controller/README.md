# Model-View-Controller

In this lesson, I learned how to organize an application project, thinking about its files, structures, and classes, and how to establish and manage relationships between objects in an application.

## What I Learned

- Describe the Model-View-Controller (`MVC`) design pattern
- Describe the role of the view controller in the `MVC` pattern
- Describe how `MVC` might change when pulling data from an external data source
- Demonstrate one common way to organize files in a project

## Vocabulary
- `abstraction`: Simplified representation of reality.
- `architecture`: Structure and organization of a system.
- `controller`: Component that manages the logic and data flow between the model and the view.
- `model`: Representation of the data and business rules of the application.
- `Model-View-Controller`: Design pattern that separates the components of the application into three main roles.
- `view`: Component responsible for displaying the user interface and receiving user input.

## `FavoriteAthlete`

In this lab, you will plan and create an application that uses a proper MVC design. The app will consist of two screens to display the user's favorite athletes, allowing them to add new athletes to the list and edit existing entries.
