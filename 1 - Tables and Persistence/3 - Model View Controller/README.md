# Model-View-Controller

At this stage of the course, I felt more comfortable with how applications work and how to build basic application functions. I saw how even relatively simple applications depend on many files, structures, and classes. I envisioned how the code for a medium-sized application could span hundreds of files in my project.

In this lesson, I learned how to organize files, structures, and classes in a design pattern called Model-View-Controller, or MVC. MVC will help me design the files in my application, as well as the interactions and relationships between different types and instances. MVC is not a trivial topic. This lesson helped me get started, but I will continue learning and reinforcing my understanding of MVC concepts for a long time. I learned the complexities of implementing proper MVC patterns in my application through example code, building my own applications, and with the guidance of mentors and teachers. I acknowledge that there is never a single correct answer for any architectural decision. There are best practices, but style and personal preference will play a role in how I choose to organize my application projects and relationship models.

## What I Learned
- How to use the Model-View-Controller pattern to design objects and relationships in my application.
- A common way to organize files in my Xcode projects.

## Vocabulary
- `abstraction`: Simplified representation of reality.
- `architecture`: Structure and organization of a system.
- `controller`: Component that manages the logic and data flow between the model and the view.
- `model`: Representation of the data and business rules of the application.
- `Model-View-Controller`: Design pattern that separates the components of the application into three main roles.
- `view`: Component responsible for displaying the user interface and receiving user input.
