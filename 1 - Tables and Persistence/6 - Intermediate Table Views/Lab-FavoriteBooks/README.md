### `Favorite books`

The goal of this lab is to implement intermediate features of the table view in an application that keeps track of your favorite books.

The code provided is a Swift implementation for an iOS application focused on managing books. The `BookTableViewController` class is a subclass of `UITableViewController` and is used to control a table view in the application's user interface. The table view is used to display a list of books, and I am responsible for managing its content and behavior.

Within this class, I declared a property called `books`, which is an array of `Book` objects. This array stores the books that will be displayed in the table view.

I configured standard table view methods such as `numberOfRowsInSection` and `cellForRowAt` to determine how many rows the table view should have and how to display book data in the cells. Additionally, I implemented a `commit editingStyle` method to allow the deletion of books by swiping a cell.

The class also contains methods related to navigation between views. The `prepareForUnwind` method handles the process of saving changes when editing an existing book or adding a new book to the `books` array. The `editBook` method is used to edit an existing book by selecting a row in the table view.

The `BookTableViewCell` class is a subclass of `UITableViewCell` and is used to customize the appearance of cells in the table view, displaying detailed information about a book. Each instance of `BookTableViewCell` contains labels (`UILabels`) to display the book's title, author, genre, and length. The `update(with:)` method is responsible for updating the labels with the relevant book information.

Lastly, the `Book` structure represents a book with properties for the title, author, genre, and length. I also implemented the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol, which allows me to generate a text representation of the book using the `description` property. This property returns a string that includes detailed information about the book, such as the title, author, genre, and length.

In summary, the provided code is a Swift implementation for an iOS book management application. It uses classes and structures to represent books and customize their display in a table view. Table view methods handle data presentation, and the `Book` structure provides a detailed textual description of a book for display. The code also includes logic for editing and navigating between views.
