# Intermediate Table Views

Table views are one of the most common views in iOS, and you'll use them in almost every app you build. In the previous lesson, you learned the basics of setting up a table view and displaying a list of information.

In this lesson, I learned how to further customize my table views with custom cells, dynamically insert and delete cells, use static table views to present forms or other lists that don't change, and allow the user to swipe to delete cells.

## What I Learned
- How to create custom-designed cells.
- How to add and delete rows from a table view.
- How to use a static table view.

## Vocabulary
- `custom table view cell`: Custom-designed element for a cell in a table view.
- `row action`: Functionality associated with a row in a table view, such as delete or share.
- `static table view`: Type of table view that displays a fixed list of items, typically used for forms or lists that don't change.
