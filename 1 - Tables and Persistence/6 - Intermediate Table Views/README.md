# Intermediate Table Views

In this lesson, I've delved into more advanced table view features, such as creating custom cells, enabling table view editing, and working with static table views.

## What I Learned

- Demonstrate how to create a custom table view cell
- Demonstrate how to use table view editing to enable swipe functionality
- Demonstrate how to use a static table view
- Describe use cases for static table views
- Demonstrate how to use table view cell actions
