# Guided Project: List

In this unit, I developed key skills by learning how to display lists using `table views`, build screens allowing complex input, and `save data to the device`. In the guided project, I integrated these skills to create an app that manages and stores lists for later retrieval. Through a custom screen, I could `add, modify, and delete items in the list`, adapting the input format based on the item type.

Throughout this process, I acquired three fundamental skills for creating common applications: the ability to list data in a `table view`, the application of the `MVC` design pattern for architecture, and knowledge of how to `persist data between application sessions`. Additionally, I explored app deployment, the construction of `scroll views`, the use of `system view controllers`, and the creation of `complex forms` to gather user information.

Now, with the ability to build `table views`, persist data, and use the `MVC` pattern to design applications, I have the capability to develop more complex apps that store data locally. This knowledge enables me to approach `new frameworks and tools` by consulting the documentation, as each builds upon the skills I have already acquired.

In the next unit, I explored how to enhance my apps by `retrieving and sending information over the Internet`. I am well on my way to becoming an experienced `iOS developer`. Congratulations!
