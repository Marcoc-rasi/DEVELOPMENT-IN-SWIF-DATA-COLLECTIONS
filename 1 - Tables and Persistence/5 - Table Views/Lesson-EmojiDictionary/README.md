### `EmojiDictionary`

The application is an implementation of a table view that is used to display a list of emojis and allows operations like deleting and rearranging items in the list.

The core of the implementation is a class called `EmojiTableViewController` that inherits from `UITableViewController`. In programming terms, "inherits" means that this class inherits properties and methods from the base class `UITableViewController`, which is a pre-defined table view in iOS. This makes it easy to create a custom table view.

Inside this class, an array named `emojis` is declared, containing objects of the `Emoji` structure. In programming, a "structure" is a data type that groups related properties. In this case, `Emoji` is a structure representing an emoji and has four key properties: `symbol`, `name`, `description`, and `usage`. These properties store the emoji's symbol, its name, a description, and its usage, respectively.

The table view is configured in the `viewDidLoad` and `viewWillAppear` methods. In `viewDidLoad`, a "Edit" button is set in the navigation bar, allowing users to edit the list of emojis. Additionally, the `cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth` property of the table is adjusted to follow the readable content width. This is relevant for right-to-left language design and ensures a proper appearance in different languages.

The table-related methods are necessary to set up and control the table view. The `numberOfSections(in tableView:)` method returns the number of sections in the table, which in this case is 1. "Sections" refer to the division of the table into distinct parts. `tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)` returns the number of rows in section 0, which equals the number of emojis in the array. Each "row" represents an item in the list.

The `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` method is crucial for configuring each cell in the table. In this method, four key steps are followed:
1. **Dequeue cell:** This refers to obtaining a cell from the reuse queue, which is an efficient technique to manage cells in the table view.
2. **Fetch model object:** The corresponding emoji is retrieved from the `emojis` array based on the row index.
3. **Configure cell:** The cell is configured with emoji information, including the symbol and description.
4. **Return cell:** Finally, the configured cell is returned.

The `tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:)` method is called when a cell is tapped and displays the symbol of the selected emoji along with its index in the list. This method enables user interaction with the emojis.

Furthermore, methods for editing the table are provided, such as `tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)` for deleting emojis from the list and `tableView(_:moveRowAt:to:)` for rearranging emojis using drag-and-drop gestures. These methods are essential to provide editing functionality in the table view.

In summary, this code is an implementation of a table view in iOS that displays a list of emojis, allowing for editing and rearranging. The `Emoji` structure is used to organize information for each emoji. The detailed technical explanation provided here covers fundamental aspects of the implementation, including class inheritance, the use of structures to model data, and the configuration of the table view in an iOS application.
