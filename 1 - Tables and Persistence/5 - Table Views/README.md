# Table Views

iOS runs on powerful devices that can handle sophisticated computing tasks, enabling users to work with large sets of data. As a developer, how can you elegantly display data so that it's efficient to view and manipulate?

Enter `UITableView`, one of the most widely used views in iOS. Table views are perfect for efficiently displaying both large and small amounts of information and for managing dynamic or static lists of data.

In this lesson, I learned why table views are so popular among iOS developers. This lesson focused on dynamic table views; the next lesson on table views will cover static table views.

## What I Learned
- How to use predefined styles of `UITableViewCell` to customize my table views.
- How to provide dynamic data to a table view.
- How to respond to user interaction in a table view.
- How to update table view data.

## Vocabulary

- `dequeuing`: Process of storing and reusing table view cells to improve performance.
- `dynamic`: Changing or adapting based on circumstances.
