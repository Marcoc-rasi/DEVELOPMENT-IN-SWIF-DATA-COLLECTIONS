# Table Views

In this lesson, I learned how to build a `scrolling` interface using the table view, the most common interface in mobile applications. I have also gained knowledge on how to instantiate and provide data to a table view.

## What I Learned

- Describe proper use cases for displaying data in table views
- Demonstrate how to provide data to a table view
- Describe the relationship between an array and the table view data source
- Describe four default cell types
- Describe table sections and reorder control
- Demonstrate how to use a table view to respond to user interaction
- Describe the purpose of the refresh control
- Describe readability margins for tables


## Vocabulary
- `accessory view`: Additional element displayed in a table view cell, such as a button or indicator.
- `dequeuing`: Process of storing and reusing table view cells to improve performance.
- `dynamic`: Changing or adapting based on circumstances.
- `index path`: Identifier representing the position of a cell in a table view.
- `readability margin`: Additional space around the content of a cell to improve presentation.
- `reordering control`: Feature that allows the user to change the order of cells in a table view.
- `table view`: Component that displays a list of items in rows and columns.
- `table view cell`: Individual element in a table view that holds data and is displayed in a row.
- `zero-based`: System where numbering starts from zero instead of one.
