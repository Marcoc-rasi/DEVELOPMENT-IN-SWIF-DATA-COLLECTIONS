# Tables and Persistence

In this unit, I have learned about scroll views, table views, and building complex input screens. I've also learned how to save data, share information with other applications, and work with images in the user's photo library. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, List, a task tracking application that allows the user to add, edit and delete items in a familiar table-based interface. I have customized the app to keep track of any type of information, such as collections, tasks or playlists.

## Swift Lessons
- `Protocols`: A set of rules that defined how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

## SDK Lessons
- `Application Lifecycle`: I understood how an application started, ran, and terminated.
- `Model-View-Controller`: I organized my code following this fundamental design pattern.
- `Scroll Views`: I implemented views that allowed content scrolling.
- `Table Views`: I used tables to display structured information.
- `Intermediate Table Views`: I delved into advanced table handling.
- `System View Controllers`: I understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- `Data Persistence`: I explored methods for storing information persistently.
- `Complex Input Screens`: I applied techniques to create complex user interfaces.

## What I Built
List was a task-tracking application that allowed me to add, edit, and delete tasks in a familiar master-detail interface. I customized the application to track any type of information, such as a collection of cards or my favorite movies.

## Application and explanation videos

### Guided Project – ToDoList-Marcocrasi

The application allows you to manage lists efficiently. You can add, modify or delete elements through a custom input interface. The app uses table views to display lists, screens designed for complex input, and a storage system to preserve data. Effective list management is facilitated, adapting to different types of elements with specific controls. In short, the app offers an optimized experience for managing and storing lists.


## Unit 1 – `Tables and Persistence`

### Lesson 1.2 - App Anatomy and Life Cycle

#### AppEventCount-Marcocrasi – Lab App

The purpose of this lab is to create an application that provides a visual representation of the application lifecycle. The application will dynamically update the labels in the UI when different delegate methods are called.

#### AppLifeCycle-Marcocrasi – Lesson App

The application provides a practical and visual understanding through the console, of the flow of life of the application through the manipulation of delegates and specific events.

### Lesson 1.3 - Model View Controller

#### FavoriteAthlete – Lab App

In this lab, you will plan and create an application that uses a proper MVC design. The app will consist of two screens to display the user's favorite athletes, allowing them to add new athletes to the list and edit existing entries.

### Lesson 1.4 - Scroll Views

#### ISpy-Marcocrasi - Lab App

This is an application that displays an image of a cat and allows zooming and panning operations within the enlarged area.

#### ScrollingForm-Marcocrasi – Lesson App

The purpose of this app is to ensure that when the keyboard appears or disappears within the application, the view automatically adjusts to keep the text entry fields visible and accessible.

#### ScrollingChallengeHorizontal - Lesson App Challenge

This app features a visually pleasing horizontal scrolling view with the user's three favorite images.

### Lesson 1.5 - Table Views

#### Meal Tracker – Marcocrasi – Lab App

You will create an application that will display a list of foods grouped into three sections, one for each meal of the day.

#### EmojiDictionary – Lesson App

The application is an implementation of a table view that is used to display a list of emojis and allows operations such as deleting and rearranging items in the list.

### Lesson 1.6 - Intermediate Table Views

#### Favorite books - Lab App

The goal of this lab is to implement intermediate features of the table view in an application that keeps track of your favorite books.

#### EmojiDictionary – Lesson App

In the application you create a list of emojis with a custom table cell that will add a third larger label aligned with the left edge of the cell to display the emoji.

### Lesson 1.7 - Saving Data

#### EmojiDictionary savin data – Lab App

Persistence will be added to Emoji objects, allowing changes made to the emoji list to persist between app restarts.

### Lesson 1.8 - System View Controllers

#### HomeFurniture - Lab App

The goal of this lab is to use system view controllers in an application that lists rooms and furniture, allowing users to share furniture items with other applications on their device.

#### SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi – Lesson App

The application integrates several key functionalities to interact with the device and perform actions such as sharing images, viewing websites, taking photos and sending emails.

#### Challenge SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi - Challenge App

The application uses the UIKit framework to create a user interface with several buttons, each of which performs different actions. These actions include sharing an image, opening a website in Safari, taking a photo with the device's camera, sending an email, and sending a text message.

### Lesson 1.9 - Complex Input Screens

#### EmployeeRoster - Lab App

The goal of this lab is to create a display that accepts complex user input. A date picker and custom delegate will be used to build an employee registry that keeps track of employee information.

#### Hotel Manzana – Lesson App

The application consists of a view controller in an iOS application that allows users to manage room reservations in a hotel.
