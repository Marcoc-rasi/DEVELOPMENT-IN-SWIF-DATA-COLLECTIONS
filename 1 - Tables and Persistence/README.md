# `Tables and Persistence`

We have explored various concepts to improve our app development skills. We highlight the use of scroll and table views, as well as the creation of complex input screens. We have also learned how to save data, share information with other applications, and work with images in the user's photo library. All this knowledge has been applied practically in the guided project, **List**. This task tracking app allows the user to manage items in a table-based interface efficiently. We've customized the app so it can accommodate different types of information, such as collections, tasks, or playlists.

## `**Featured Lessons**`

### `**Swift Lessons**`
- **Protocols:** A set of rules that define how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

### `**SDK Lessons**`
- **Application Life Cycle:** We understood the start, execution and termination of an application.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** We organize our code following this fundamental design pattern.
- **Scroll Views:** We implemented views that allow content scrolling.
- **Table Views:** We use tables to display structured information.
- **Intermediate Table Views:** We delve into advanced table management.
- **System View Controllers:** We understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- **Data Saving:** We explore methods to store information persistently.
- **Complex Input Screens:** We apply techniques to create complex user interfaces.

## `**Application and Explanation Videos**`

### `**Guided Project – ToDoList-Marcocrasi**`
The application allows you to manage lists efficiently. You can add, modify or delete elements through a custom input interface. The app uses table views to display lists, screens designed for complex input, and a storage system to preserve data. Effective list management is facilitated, adapting to different types of elements with specific controls. In short, the app offers an optimized experience for managing and storing lists.

## `**Unit 1 – Tables and Persistence**`

### `**Lesson 1.2 - App Anatomy and Life Cycle**`

#### `**AppEventCount-Marcocrasi – Lab App**`
This lab aims to create an application that provides a visual representation of the application lifecycle. The application will dynamically update the labels in the UI when different delegate methods are called.

#### `**AppLifeCycle-Marcocrasi – Lesson App**`
The application provides a practical and visual understanding through the console, of the flow of life of the application through the manipulation of delegates and specific events.

### `**Lesson 1.3 - Model View Controller**`

#### `**FavoriteAthlete – Lab App**`
In this lab, you will plan and create an application that uses a proper MVC design. The app will consist of two screens to display the user's favorite athletes, allowing them to add new athletes to the list and edit existing entries.

### `**Lesson 1.4 - Scroll Views**`

#### `**ISpy-Marcocrasi - Lab App**`
This application displays an image of a cat and allows zooming and panning operations within the enlarged area.

#### `**ScrollingForm-Marcocrasi – Lesson App**`
This app automatically adjusts the view when the keyboard appears or disappears, keeping text entry fields visible and accessible.

#### `**ScrollingChallengeHorizontal - Lesson App Challenge**`
This app features a visually pleasing horizontal scrolling view with the user's three favorite images.

### `**Lesson 1.5 - Table Views**`

#### `**Meal Tracker – Marcocrasi – Lab App**`
You will create an application that will display a list of foods grouped into three sections, one for each meal of the day.

#### `**EmojiDictionary – Lesson App**`
This application is an implementation of a table view that is used to display a list of emojis and allows operations such as deleting and rearranging items in the list.

### `**Lesson 1.6 - Intermediate Table Views**`

#### `**Favorite books - Lab App**`
The goal of this lab is to implement intermediate features of the table view in an application that keeps track of your favorite books.

#### `**EmojiDictionary – Lesson App**`
In this app, an emoji list is created with a custom table cell that adds a third, larger label aligned to the left edge of the cell to display the emoji.

### `**Lesson 1.7 - Saving Data**`

#### `**EmojiDictionary saving data – Lab App**`
Persistence will be added to Emoji objects, allowing changes made to the emoji list to persist between app restarts.

### `**Lesson 1.8 - System View Controllers**`

#### `**HomeFurniture - Lab App**`
The goal of this lab is to use system view controllers in an application that lists rooms and furniture, allowing users to share furniture items with other applications on their device.

#### `**SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi – Lesson App**`
The application integrates several key functionalities to interact with the device and perform actions such as sharing images, viewing websites, taking photos and sending emails.

#### `**Challenge SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi - Challenge App**`
The application uses the UIKit framework to create a user interface with several buttons, each of which performs different actions. These actions include sharing an image, opening a website in Safari, taking a photo with the device's camera, sending an email, and sending a text message.

### `**Lesson 1.9 - Complex Input Screens**`

#### `**EmployeeRoster - Lab App**`
The goal of this lab is to create a display that accepts complex user input. A date picker and custom delegate will be used to build an employee registry that keeps track of employee information.

#### `**Hotel Manzana – Lesson App**`
The application consists of a view controller in an iOS application that allows users to manage room reservations in a hotel
