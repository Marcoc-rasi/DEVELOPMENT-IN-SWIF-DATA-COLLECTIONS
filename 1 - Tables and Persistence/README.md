# Tables and Persistence

In this unit, I have learned about scroll views, table views, and building complex input screens. I've also learned how to save data, share information with other applications, and work with images in the user's photo library. I have applied this knowledge in the guided project, List, a task tracking application that allows the user to add, edit and delete items in a familiar table-based interface. I have customized the app to keep track of any type of information, such as collections, tasks or playlists.

## Swift Lessons
- `Protocols`: A set of rules that defined how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

## SDK Lessons
- `Application Lifecycle`: I understood how an application started, ran, and terminated.
- `Model-View-Controller`: I organized my code following this fundamental design pattern.
- `Scroll Views`: I implemented views that allowed content scrolling.
- `Table Views`: I used tables to display structured information.
- `Intermediate Table Views`: I delved into advanced table handling.
- `System View Controllers`: I understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- `Data Persistence`: I explored methods for storing information persistently.
- `Complex Input Screens`: I applied techniques to create complex user interfaces.

## What I Built
List was a task-tracking application that allowed me to add, edit, and delete tasks in a familiar master-detail interface. I customized the application to track any type of information, such as a collection of cards or my favorite movies.
