# `Tables and Persistence`

We have explored various concepts to enhance our skills in application development. We highlighted the use of scroll views and tables, as well as the creation of complex input screens. We have also learned to save data, share information with other applications, and work with images in the user's photo library. All this knowledge has been practically applied in the guided project, List. This task-tracking application allows the user to efficiently manage items in a table-based interface. We have customized the application to adapt to different types of information, such as collections, tasks, or playlists.

## `Highlighted Lessons`

### `Swift Lessons`
- Protocols: A set of rules that define how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

### `SDK Lessons`
- `Application Life Cycle:` We understood the start, execution, and termination of an application.
- `Model-View-Controller (MVC):` We organized our code following this fundamental design pattern.
- `Scroll Views:` Implemented views that allow content scrolling.
- `Table Views:` Used tables to display structured information.
- `Intermediate Table Views:` Explored advanced table handling.
- `System View Controllers:` Understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- `Data Persistence:` Explored methods for storing information persistently.
- `Complex Input Screens:` Applied techniques for creating complex user interfaces.

## `Application Videos and Explanation`

### `Guided Project – ToDoList-Marcocrasi`
The application efficiently manages lists. Users can add, modify, or delete items through a custom input interface. The app utilizes table views to display lists, screens designed for complex input, and a storage system to preserve data. It facilitates effective list management, adapting to different types of items with specific controls. In summary, the app provides an optimized experience for list management and storage.

## `Unit 1 – Tables and Persistence`

### `Lesson 1.2 - App Anatomy and Life Cycle`

#### `AppEventCount-Marcocrasi – Lab App`
This lab aims to create an application that visually represents the application life cycle. The application dynamically updates labels on the user interface when different delegate methods are called.

#### `AppLifeCycle-Marcocrasi – Lesson App`
The application provides practical and visual understanding, through the console, of the application's life cycle flow via delegate and specific events manipulation.

### `Lesson 1.3 - Model View Controller`

#### `FavoriteAthlete – Lab App`
In this lab, you will plan and create an application that uses proper MVC design. The application will consist of two screens to display the user's favorite athletes, allowing them to add new athletes to the list and edit existing entries.

### `Lesson 1.4 - Scroll Views`

#### `ISpy-Marcocrasi - Lab App`
This application displays an image of a cat and allows zoom and scroll operations within the enlarged area.

#### `ScrollingForm-Marcocrasi – Lesson App`
This app automatically adjusts the view when the keyboard appears or disappears, keeping text input fields visible and accessible.

#### `ScrollingChallengeHorizontal - Lesson App Challenge`
This application presents a visually pleasing horizontally scrolling view with the user's three favorite images.

### `Lesson 1.5 - Table Views`

#### `Meal Tracker – Marcocrasi – Lab App`
You will create an application that displays a list of foods grouped into three sections, one for each meal of the day.

#### `EmojiDictionary – Lesson App`
This application is an implementation of a table view used to display a list of emojis and allows operations such as deleting and rearranging items in the list.

### `Lesson 1.6 - Intermediate Table Views`

#### `Favorite books - Lab App`
The goal of this lab is to implement intermediate features of the table view in an application that tracks your favorite books.

#### `EmojiDictionary – Lesson App`
In this application, a list of emojis is created with a custom table cell that adds a third, larger label aligned with the left edge of the cell to display the emoji.

### `Lesson 1.7 - Saving Data`

#### `EmojiDictionary saving data – Lab App`
Persistence will be added to Emoji objects, allowing changes made to the emoji list to persist between application restarts.

### `Lesson 1.8 - System View Controllers`

#### `HomeFurniture - Lab App`
The goal of this lab is to use system view controllers in an application that lists rooms and furniture, allowing users to share furniture items with other applications on their device.

#### `SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi – Lesson App`
The application integrates various key functionalities to interact with the device and perform actions such as sharing images, viewing websites, taking photos, and sending emails.

#### `Challenge SystemViewControllers-Marcocrasi - Challenge App`
The application uses the UIKit framework to create a user interface with several buttons, each performing different actions. These actions include sharing an image, opening a website in Safari, taking a photo with the device's camera, sending an email, and sending a text message.

### `Lesson 1.9 - Complex Input Screens`

#### `EmployeeRoster - Lab App`
The goal of this lab is to create a screen that accepts complex user input. A date picker and a custom delegate will be used to build an employee roster that tracks employee information.

#### `Hotel Manzana – Lesson App`
The application consists of a view controller in an iOS app that allows users to manage room reservations in a hotel.
