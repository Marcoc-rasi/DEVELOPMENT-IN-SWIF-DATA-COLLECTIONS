# `Tables and Persistence`

We have explored various concepts to enhance our skills in application development. We highlighted the use of scroll views and tables, as well as the creation of complex input screens. We have also learned to save data, share information with other applications, and work with images in the user's photo library. All this knowledge has been practically applied in the guided project, List. This task-tracking application allows the user to efficiently manage items in a table-based interface. We have customized the application to adapt to different types of information, such as collections, tasks, or playlists.

## `Highlighted Lessons`

### `Swift Lessons`
- Protocols: A set of rules that define how a class or structure should implement certain methods and properties.

### `SDK Lessons`
- `Application Life Cycle:` We understood the start, execution, and termination of an application.
- `Model-View-Controller (MVC):` We organized our code following this fundamental design pattern.
- `Scroll Views:` Implemented views that allow content scrolling.
- `Table Views:` Used tables to display structured information.
- `Intermediate Table Views:` Explored advanced table handling.
- `System View Controllers:` Understood the role of system-provided view controllers.
- `Data Persistence:` Explored methods for storing information persistently.
- `Complex Input Screens:` Applied techniques for creating complex user interfaces.

## `Application Videos and Explanation`

### `Guided Project – ToDoList-Marcocrasi`
The application efficiently manages lists. Users can add, modify, or delete items through a custom input interface. The app utilizes table views to display lists, screens designed for complex input, and a storage system to preserve data. It facilitates effective list management, adapting to different types of items with specific controls. In summary, the app provides an optimized experience for list management and storage.
