### `ScrollingForm-Marcocrasi`

The purpose of this code is to ensure that when the keyboard appears or disappears within the application, the view automatically adjusts to keep the text entry fields visible and accessible.

Within the `ViewController` class, a property called `scrollView` is declared, representing a `UIScrollView` object. This object is used to create a scrollable view in the user interface.

The `viewDidLoad()` method is executed when the view loads. Here, the initial view setup is performed, including the registration of keyboard-related notifications by calling `registerForKeyboardNotifications()`.

The `registerForKeyboardNotifications()` method is responsible for registering two system notifications: one triggered when the keyboard is shown and another when it is hidden. These notifications are crucial for responding to keyboard-related events.

When the keyboard is shown, the `keyboardWasShown(_:)` method is called. In this method, information about the keyboard, such as its size, is obtained, and this information is used to adjust the content of the `scrollView`. The `contentInset` and `scrollIndicatorInsets` properties of the `scrollView` are modified to ensure that text input fields remain visible.

When the keyboard is about to be hidden, the `keyboardWillBeHidden(_)` method is called. In this case, the `contentInset` and `scrollIndicatorInsets` properties of the `scrollView` are reset to their original state, ensuring that the view returns to its normal position.

In summary, this code is essential for ensuring a seamless user experience in an iOS application. When the keyboard is shown, the view automatically adjusts to prevent the keyboard from covering user interface elements. When the keyboard is hidden, the view returns to its original state. This approach enhances usability by allowing users to interact with text input fields conveniently, without keyboard obstructions. The use of system notifications and manipulation of the `scrollView` are key to achieving this behavior.
