# Scroll Views

In this lesson, I learned how to build a scrolling interface that allows users to see more content than fits on the device's screen. I have also gained knowledge on how to instantiate and provide data to a scroll view.


## What I Learned

- Describe common uses for scroll views
- Demonstrate how to display more information on a single screen using a scroll view
- Describe the relationship of the scroll view to table views and collection views


## Vocabulary
- `bounds`: Rectangular area representing the size and position of a view in relation to its own coordinate system.
- `content inset`: Additional space around the content of a view.
- `content view`: Area containing the actual content within a scroll view.
- `frame`: Rectangular area representing the size and position of a view in relation to its superview's coordinate system.
- `scroll view`: Component that allows displaying content larger than the screen and enables the user to scroll to view different parts of the content.
