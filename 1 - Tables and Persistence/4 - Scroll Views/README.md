# Scroll Views

So far in this course, all my views have neatly fit their content within a single screen. As my ideas for applications grow, I may not always be able to claim the same. What if I want users to complete a long form, like a registration page? Or perhaps I want to allow them to examine the details of a very large image. What approach should I take?

In this lesson, I learned how to use a `UIScrollView` to display content that is larger than the device's screen and allow the user to interact with it.

## What I Learned
- How and when to use scroll views.
- How to use scroll views with Auto Layout and stack views.
- How to add padding around my content.

## Vocabulary
- `bounds`: Rectangular area representing the size and position of a view in relation to its own coordinate system.
- `content inset`: Additional space around the content of a view.
- `content view`: Area containing the actual content within a scroll view.
- `frame`: Rectangular area representing the size and position of a view in relation to its superview's coordinate system.
- `scroll view`: Component that allows displaying content larger than the screen and enables the user to scroll to view different parts of the content.
